# NEXUS: Global Swarm Command — Game Vision

## The Elevator Pitch

**"Hearts of Iron meets VTOL VR — a near-future military simulation where sensor fusion IS the gameplay, and the game teaches itself through play instead of manuals."**

You are a swarm commander in 2042. Autonomous robots have replaced soldiers. Your weapon isn't firepower — it's *information*. Layer satellites, drones, sonar arrays, and ELINT platforms to see through the fog of war. What you can't see, you can't kill. What you emit to see, the enemy can detect. Every sensor decision is a tradeoff.

Start commanding a single recon swarm. End commanding a global theater war. The game teaches you every step of the way.

## What This Game IS

- A **sensor fusion puzzle** wrapped in a military simulation
- A **modern Hearts of Iron** with a learning curve that doesn't require a PhD
- A **Palantir/Lattice command interface** you actually get to operate
- A **single-player-first** experience with variable time (pause → 100x)
- A game where **information warfare matters more than firepower**
- Built by **one human directing AI coding agents**

## What This Game IS NOT

- A fast-twitch RTS where APM matters
- A micro-management game where you click individual units
- A casual game with simplified mechanics
- Multiplayer-first (single-player is the priority)
- A game that assumes you know military doctrine to start playing

## Design Pillars

### 1. The Emission Economy
Every sensor action costs something. Radar reveals your position to ELINT at ~2x your detection range. Jammers defeat radar but become beacons. Even IFF interrogations create detectable pulses. The core decision loop: **emit to see, but be seen — or stay silent and accept uncertainty.** This is not a secondary mechanic. This IS the game.

### 2. Layered Detection as Gameplay
No single sensor gives you the full picture. Satellite gives you "something is there." Radar gives you "it's an aircraft." EO/IR gives you "it's a Su-27." IFF + emissions correlation confirms "hostile." Each layer requires different assets, time, and risk. The player's core job is building and maintaining sensor coverage — deciding where to look, what to look with, and what risks to accept.

### 3. Teach Through Play, Not Manuals
Hearts of Iron's fatal flaw: it assumes you'll read a wiki. NEXUS teaches every mechanic through gameplay. Mission 1 hands you 4 recon drones and says "find the submarine." You learn sensors by using them. Each mission introduces ONE new concept. By mission 20, you're commanding a full theater war — and you understand every system because you learned them one at a time.

### 4. Simulation Depth with Strategic Clarity
Rimworld's lesson: simple individual systems create complex emergent behavior. Each NEXUS system is understandable in isolation (weather affects sensor range, terrain blocks line-of-sight, cold degrades electronics). Together, they create scenarios where an Arctic fog event + aurora-disrupted comms + enemy EMCON discipline = a submarine getting within torpedo range of your carrier. The player doesn't need to understand the math. They need to understand that weather matters, comms matter, and silence is dangerous.

### 5. Time is the Player's Tool
Like Hearts of Iron: pause to plan, 1x for critical moments, 10x for transit, 100x for strategic repositioning. The game respects your time. You're a commander, not a twitch player. Variable time step means you can spend 10 minutes planning a sensor net, then fast-forward 6 hours of patrol until something interesting happens.

## The Core Fantasy

You sit at a darkened command console. A 3D globe slowly rotates. Cyan markers show your sensor coverage — but most of the world is dark. You're looking for a Chinese carrier group that's gone silent somewhere in the Philippine Sea.

You task a SENTINEL satellite to sweep the probable area. 90 minutes until it passes overhead. Too long. You redirect a SPECTER drone swarm south — they'll reach sensor range in 45 minutes, but they're running passive-only (no radar, just ELINT receivers). If the carrier group breaks radio silence, you'll hear them.

Meanwhile, you deploy sonobuoys from a P-8 patrol pattern. Passive — listening for propeller cavitation. One sonobuoy picks up something. Submarine? Surface ship? Can't tell yet. The confidence marker says 23% — "Anomaly." You need more data.

You could go active sonar. You'd know in seconds what's down there. But active sonar announces your presence to everything within 40 kilometers. If it's the carrier group's submarine screen, they'll know you're hunting them.

So you wait. Layer more passive sonobuoys around the anomaly. Task the SPECTER swarm to overfly the area with IR sensors. Cross-reference the sonar anomaly with satellite-detected thermal wake patterns.

Thirty minutes later, the picture builds. The anomaly upgrades to "Track" — submarine, heading northwest, 8 knots. Two more contacts appear on ELINT — brief radar emissions, consistent with destroyer navigation radar. Now you're at 67% confidence: "Track — probable hostile surface group."

You authorize the SPECTERs to go active radar for one 10-second sweep. That sweep will give you everything — count, composition, heading, speed. But it will also tell the carrier group exactly where your drones are.

**That 10-second decision is the game.**

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Players who love the *idea* of Hearts of Iron, Command: Modern Operations, or DCS World but bounced off the learning curve. People who watch military analysis on YouTube (Perun, CaspianReport, Binkov). Defense technology enthusiasts who follow Anduril, Palantir, SpaceX. Strategy gamers who want depth but also want the game to teach them.

**Secondary:** Existing HOI/CMO/Wargame veterans looking for a modern take with better UX. Military simulation enthusiasts. Near-future sci-fi fans.

**Age:** 17+ (realistic autonomous warfare depiction)

**Platform behavior:** Plays in 1-3 hour sessions. Pauses frequently. Alt-tabs to think about strategy. Comes back to the game thinking about what they'll do next. Watches YouTube content about the game between sessions.

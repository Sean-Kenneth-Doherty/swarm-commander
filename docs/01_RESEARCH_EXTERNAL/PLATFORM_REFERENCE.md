## Design Principle

NEXUS platforms are **abstractions** that capture the essential gameplay characteristics of real systems without simulating specific real-world platforms. This allows:
- Fictional setting freedom
- Balance without realism debates
- Near-future speculation
- Avoiding political sensitivity

The goal: **feel real** without **being real**.

# Real-World Conflict Scenarios

> Analysis of potential near-future conflict theaters that inform NEXUS campaign design.

---

## Taiwan Strait (Primary Theater)

### Strategic Context
- **Stakes:** Control of Taiwan, semiconductor supply chain, regional dominance
- **Terrain:** 100-mile strait, mountainous island, dense urban areas
- **Key challenge:** Amphibious assault under sensor coverage

### Sensor Environment
- Dense IADS on both sides
- Submarine choke points
- Limited airspace depth
- Heavy ELINT/SIGINT activity
- Satellite coverage gaps over open water

### NEXUS Campaign Application
- **Missions 13-15:** Taiwan Strait crisis
- Emphasizes: maritime patrol, submarine hunting, amphibious defense
- Player manages A2/AD bubble vs. force projection

---

## South China Sea

### Strategic Context
- **Stakes:** Freedom of navigation, territorial claims, resource access
- **Terrain:** Island chains, shallow reefs, vast open ocean
- **Key challenge:** Distributed operations across huge distances

### Sensor Environment
- Long detection ranges over water
- Island bases as sensor platforms
- Submarine-rich environment
- Limited weather complications (tropical storms seasonal)

### NEXUS Campaign Application
- **Missions 16-17:** Island chain defense/offense
- Emphasizes: long-range sensor coverage, logistics, forward basing

---

## Arctic Theater

### Strategic Context
- **Stakes:** Northern sea routes, resource extraction, strategic depth
- **Terrain:** Ice coverage (variable by season), extreme cold, limited infrastructure
- **Key challenge:** Environmental effects on all systems

### Sensor Environment
- Aurora disrupts HF/OTH radar
- Cold degrades electronics
- Ice masks submarine signatures
- Limited satellite coverage at high latitudes
- Extreme day/night cycles affect EO/IR

### NEXUS Campaign Application
- **Missions 18-19:** Arctic operations
- Emphasizes: weather, environmental adaptation, logistics constraints

---

## Baltic Sea

### Strategic Context
- **Stakes:** NATO Article 5, Kaliningrad, Baltic state defense
- **Terrain:** Shallow, enclosed sea; dense coastal areas; proximity to major powers
- **Key challenge:** Escalation management, compressed geography

### Sensor Environment
- Extremely dense — everyone can see everyone
- Short engagement timelines
- Urban terrain complications
- Heavy EW presence

### NEXUS Campaign Application
- **Missions 10-12:** NATO exercise scenario (training)
- Emphasizes: multi-domain coordination, ROE constraints, political capital

---

## Horn of Africa / Gulf of Aden

### Strategic Context
- **Stakes:** Shipping lane security, regional stability, counter-piracy
- **Terrain:** Narrow straits, coastal zones, desert hinterland
- **Key challenge:** Asymmetric threats, civilian traffic discrimination

### Sensor Environment
- Dense commercial shipping (contact discrimination challenge)
- Coastal clutter
- Limited adversary sensor capability
- Small boat swarms

### NEXUS Campaign Application
- **Missions 6-8:** Counter-swarm operations
- Emphasizes: target discrimination, ROE, collateral damage

## Common Doctrinal Elements Across Theaters

| Element | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| A2/AD bubbles | Enemy denial zones requiring sensor penetration |
| Kill chains | F2T2EA timelines vary by theater |
| Logistics | Distance from FOB affects sustainability |
| Politics | Escalation/de-escalation pressures |
| Weather | Theater-specific environmental factors |

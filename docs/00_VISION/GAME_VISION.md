# NEXUS: Global Swarm Command — Game Vision

> **A simulation-game hybrid that teaches real operational concepts through play.**
> Command autonomous systems across real-world terrain. Learn how modern sensor-based warfare actually works.

## The Elevator Pitch

**"Command autonomous warfare systems in a near-future world where information superiority wins wars. Learn real military concepts — kill chains, sensor fusion, EMCON — through gameplay, not manuals."**

You are a commander in the 2040s. Autonomous drones, ships, and aircraft have transformed warfare. Your weapon isn't firepower — it's *information*. Layer sensors to see through the fog of war. What you can't see, you can't kill. What you emit to see, the enemy can detect.

Start commanding a single recon mission. End commanding theater-scale operations across real-world terrain.

## What This Game IS

- A **sensor fusion puzzle** wrapped in operational military simulation
- A **training simulation that's also a great game** — learn real concepts through play
- A **Palantir/Lattice-style command interface** you actually get to operate
- A **scaling experience** — from tactical drone operator to theater commander
- **Real nations, real terrain, realistic platforms** — grounded in actual technology trajectories
- Built by **one human directing AI coding agents**

## What This Game IS NOT

- An arcade shooter or fast-twitch RTS
- A game that simplifies reality into gamey abstractions
- Multiplayer-first (single-player campaign is the priority)
- Political commentary — neutral simulation, player draws conclusions
- A game where AI makes mistakes you have to babysit

## Design Pillars

### 1. Information Is The Weapon

The core gameplay loop: **build sensor coverage → detect contacts → classify and identify → decide to engage → assess results**. This is the real F2T2EA kill chain (Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage, Assess). Combat is the payoff for sensor work, not the main event. 80% of gameplay is the information problem. 20% is acting on it.

### 2. The Emission Economy

Every active sensor is a tradeoff. Radar reveals targets but announces your presence to ELINT at ~2× your detection range. Jammers blind enemy radar but become beacons. The core decision: **emit to see, but be seen — or stay silent and accept uncertainty.** This creates constant tactical tension.

### 3. Teach The Real Thing

Use authentic military terminology — EMCON, ROE, BDA, bingo fuel. Explain it well through contextual tooltips and mission design. Players should walk away with **operational understanding** — they could explain a kill chain to a friend, understand why EMCON discipline matters, recognize what's happening in real military footage.

### 4. Mission-Based Tasking

Players command through **mission orders**, not abstract parameter sliders:
- **Mission type:** Search, Patrol, Strike, Escort, Map, Suppress
- **Mission parameters:** EMCON level, Rules of Engagement
- **Standing orders:** What to do after mission completion
- **Autonomy level:** How much freedom within the mission scope

This mirrors how real commanders operate. You don't set "aggression to 0.7" — you order "search this sector, passive sensors only, report contacts, do not engage."

### 5. Perfect Tools, Imperfect Commanders

The AI executes mission parameters perfectly. If outcomes are bad, it's because the commander (player) gave bad orders or bad parameters — not because the AI made a mistake. **Mastery means learning to give good orders.** No "stupid AI" frustration. The tools do exactly what you tell them.

### 6. Scale Through Campaign

Your role grows with the campaign:
- **Early (Tactical):** Direct command of single asset groups. Learn the systems.
- **Mid (Operations):** Multiple simultaneous operations. Learn delegation.
- **Late (Theater):** Strategic objectives, information flow, command presence.

The pacing emerges from scale: small missions feel like focused puzzles; theater operations feel like continuous warfare with planning and execution overlapping.

## The Core Fantasy

You sit in a darkened command center. Multiple displays show sensor feeds, a 3D globe, incoming intelligence. You're hunting a submarine group that's gone silent somewhere in the Philippine Sea.

You task a maritime patrol aircraft to deploy a sonobuoy pattern. Passive listening — no active pings that would alert the target.

A sonobuoy detects something. Confidence: 23% — "Anomaly." Could be a submarine. Could be a whale. Could be a thermal layer playing tricks.

You order a second aircraft to deploy additional buoys around the contact. Triangulation. Confidence builds: 45% — "Contact, subsurface." Getting warmer.

Your EW asset detects a brief radar emission 200km away. Someone broke EMCON. Cross-referencing with the subsurface contact... they're operating together. Confidence jumps: 67% — "Track, probable hostile submarine group."

You could go active sonar. You'd know in seconds exactly what's down there. But active sonar announces the hunt. They'd know you found them. They'd go deep, run silent, maybe get a shot off first.

So you wait. Layer more passive assets. Request a satellite pass. Build the picture.

Twenty minutes later: 89% confidence — "Identified: Kilo-class submarine, hostile."

You authorize the engagement.

**That decision — when to go from watching to acting — is the game.**

## Target Audience

**Primary:** People fascinated by modern military technology and operations who want to understand how it actually works. Viewers of military analysis content (Perun, CaspianReport, Binkov). Strategy gamers who bounced off the learning curves of HOI4 or Command: Modern Operations. Defense technology enthusiasts following Anduril, Palantir, Shield AI.

**Secondary:** Existing wargame enthusiasts looking for a modern, accessible take. Near-future military fiction fans. People who want a serious simulation that's also a good game.

**Not targeting:** Casual gamers, action-focused players, people who want quick dopamine hits.

**What they want:** To feel like a competent commander. To understand something real. To solve interesting problems. To see their learning pay off in mastery.

## World and Setting

### Real-World Grounding

- **Real nations:** US, China, Russia, regional powers. Real geopolitical tensions.
- **Real terrain:** Actual geography — Taiwan Strait, South China Sea, Arctic, Baltic.
- **Realistic platforms:** Inspired by real technology trajectories:
  - Autonomous jets (like Fury, XQ-58 Valkyrie)
  - AWACS and maritime patrol aircraft
  - Autonomous surface vessels (like Sea Hunter)
  - UUVs (unmanned underwater vehicles)
  - Quadcopter swarms (like those used in Ukraine)
  - Loitering munitions (like Switchblade, Lancet)
  - Satellite constellations

### Near-Future Extrapolation (2040s)

Not science fiction. Extrapolation of current trajectories:
- Autonomous systems are primary combat platforms
- Human role is command and oversight, not piloting
- Sensor networks and data fusion are decisive
- Electronic warfare is constant
- Space-based assets are critical and contested

### Neutral Stance

The game shows how autonomous warfare works. It doesn't advocate for or against it. Players experience the capabilities and costs. They draw their own conclusions.

## Core Player Emotions

Based on design interviews, the core emotional experience is:

1. **Mastery** — Satisfaction of orchestrating complex systems into perfect execution
2. **Puzzle-solving** — Cracking the information problem like a detective finding clues
3. **Power** — The god's-eye thrill of commanding autonomous warfare at scale

The **"one more turn" hook** is **unlock progression** — wanting to see the next platform, the next capability, the next theater.

## Session and Pacing

### Variable Session Length

- **Quick session (20-30 min):** Single tactical mission, clear objective, satisfying conclusion
- **Medium session (1-2 hours):** Mission chain, see progression, natural stopping points
- **Deep session (3+ hours):** Theater operations, multiple fronts, campaign advancement

### Emergent Pacing

Pacing isn't imposed by game structure — it emerges from scenario scale:
- **Small scope:** Focused puzzle. One problem. Time to think.
- **Large scope:** Continuous flow. Multiple competing priorities. Planning and execution overlap.

## Success Criteria

The game succeeds if:

1. **Players learn something real** — they understand sensor fusion, kill chains, EMCON after playing
2. **The sensor puzzle is satisfying** — building the picture feels like solving a mystery
3. **Mastery is achievable** — players get better at giving orders over time
4. **Scale feels earned** — theater command feels like a natural evolution, not overwhelming
5. **"One more mission" hook works** — progression and unlocks drive continued play
6. **Real operators recognize it** — actual military/defense professionals find it credible
